# Treatment heterogeneity in comparative effectiveness of teriparatide vs bisphosphonates: a multi-database cohort study

## About
**Background**: Bisphosphonates are first-line treatments to prevent osteoporotic fractures. Teriparatide has been recently shown to be more effective in a head-to-head RCT and is currently used for more severe cases.

**Objectives**: To study the comparative effectiveness of teriparatide vs bisphosphonates to reduce hip fracture risk. In addition, we stratified by predicted risk to assess treatment effect heterogeneity.

**Diagnostics**: Cohort diagnostics on the considered databases can be found [here](https://arekkas.shinyapps.io/ter_bis_diagnostics/).

**Results**: The most recent results of the analyses can be explored [here](https://arekkas.shinyapps.io/ter_bis_3dbs/).
